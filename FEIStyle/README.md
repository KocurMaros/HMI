# FEIstyle
[![Latest Version](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Kyslik/FEIStyle.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle/releases)
[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)

Upgraded FEIStyle ([original](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle)) modified for use at the Institute of Robotics and Cybernetics FEI STU. 
 
 - Use Times New Roman font for consistency with the [official MS word templates from URK](https://urk.fei.stuba.sk/semester/pazp)
 - support for citation standard [ISO-690](https://github.com/michal-h21/biblatex-iso690) required by [STU FEI](http://www.fei.stuba.sk/sk/kniznica-fei/vzory-bibliografickych-odkazov-a-citovanie.html?page_id=1756), using biber
 - support for <strike>acronym</strike> glossaries package
 - removed FEIstyle.bst (not needed)
 - added Makefile
 - added seminar paper template (**example_paper.tex**) [example_paper.pdf](example_paper.pdf)
 - <strike>python script (utils/tree.py) to auto-generate contents of electronic medium (**attachmentA.tex**)</strike>
 - improved contents of electronic medium example, added 2 commands to make it easy to write [**attachmentA.tex**](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle/blob/master/includes/attachmentA.tex) like files
 
>**Note**: FEIstyle supports **only UTF-8** encoding.

### Changelog

Change-log is located [here](CHANGELOG.md). 

>**Note**: Minor changes are not noted in change-log.

# Usage
 - Download all [files](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle/archive/master.zip) from repository, extract to desired folder and enjoy.

# Compile chain

In following sub-chapters `file` is your main `file.tex` (e.g.: `diploma.tex` in root folder)

## Manual compiling

Following chain should output `file.pdf`

```
$ pdflatex file
$ biber file
$ glossary file
$ pdflatex file
$ pdflatex file #not a typo!
```

## Using *latexmk*
>**Note**: see [Hints and Trics](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle#hints-and-trics) section to get information on how to install **letexmk**

Following command runs necessary compile chain.

```
$ latexmk -pdf -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode -silent file
```

## Using Makefile (uses *latexmk*)

>**Note**: make sure to change file-name in Makefile on line [#2](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle/blob/master/Makefile#L2)

Build in `.build` folder

```
$ make
```

Clean `.build` folder and delete PDF file in parent folder

```
$ make clean
```

Combine two commands above

```
$ make refresh
```

Read more on how to be even more efficient with [latexmk && make](https://drewsilcock.co.uk/using-make-and-latexmk).

## Sublime-text 3 project file
Repository consists of ST3 project file which includes building your PDF using `SUPER+b`.

>**Note**: to enable building with short-cut `tools->Build System->FEI-LaTeX`

You can also install [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) to make build / debug process even easier. File [fei.sublime-project](https://github.com/Kyslik/FEIStyle/blob/master/fei.sublime-project) comes with settings set to build your documentation - just edit `TEXroot` setting.

## Counting words, lines and characters

There is a variety of ways to count words and lines (characters are not so important) of compiled PDF file, and none is precise so we list a few and you can compare results yourself.

**Using ps2ascii**

```
$ ps2ascii example.pdf |  wc -l -w -c
```

**Using pdftotext**

```
pdftotext example.pdf - | wc -l -w -c
```

>**Note**: [CZRP](http://cms.crzp.sk/) does word counting differently, for example my thesis using `ps2ascii` method outputs *4288*, *21031*, *145198*; `pdftotext` method outputs *7051*, *21377*, *148535*; CZRP word count is *14039* and character count *138687*.
 
Counting words from source file (**not recommended**, since template does a lot of `/include`ing and `/input`ting).

```
texcount -inc example.tex
```

## Installation on macOS

 - install [MacTex distribution](https://tug.org/mactex/) using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) (~2GB / 6GB installed)

    ```
    $ brew cask install mactex
    ```
 - you can download MacTex manually from [tug.org](http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html).

>**Note**: MacTex installs also BibDesk which can be used to maintain your bibliography in a very nice way.

### Updating TeX packages

If you installed MacTex distribution you also have application called TeX Live Utility (it is a front-end for `pkmgr` program) which is used to upgrade all TeX related packages, open it from time to time and do a full update.

## Installation on Ubuntu / Fedora using eitl

>**Note**: biblatex-iso690 is included in 2016 build of texlive

Do following steps only if you have texlive 2015 or less

 - download install script
  
   ```
   $ wget http://mirrors.ctan.org/support/texlive/eitl.zip
   ```
 
 - unzip
   
   ```
   $ unzip eitl.zip && cd eitl
   ```

 - install TexLive
 
   ```
   $ ./eitl /usr/share/texlive
   ```

# TODO

 - [ ] <strike>working example on [Sharelatex.com](https://www.sharelatex.com)</strike>
   - Sharelatex does not support biblatex-iso690 at this time 
 - [ ] transform **tutorial.pdf** to wiki page
 - [ ] update read-me to include usage for Windows OS users
 - [x] update csquotes style to Slovak after [this PR](https://github.com/josephwright/csquotes/pull/9) is merged, (perhaps in 2017)
   - optional since not everyone has up-to-date packages installed
 - [x] <strike>auto-generate contents of electronic medium</strike>
   - electronic medium should be brief with explanation, see example
 - [x] publish example of electronic medium
